µm2 web framework

To install:

  - Point your docroot at web/
  - If you're using apache, make sure mod_rewrite is enabled (do the same for other servers)
  - Run core/cli/bake.php from CLI. This "bakes" (compiles) the example site(s).
  - copy config/config.orig.php into config/config.php, review its contents and modify what you see fit

That should be all.
